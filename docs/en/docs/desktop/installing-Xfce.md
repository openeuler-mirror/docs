# Xfce Installation

Xfce is a lightweight Linux desktop. In the current version, all components have been updated from GTK2 to GTK3 and from D-Dbus Glib to GDBus. Most components support GObject Introspection (GI), which is used to generate and parse the API meta information of the C program library, so that the dynamic language (or managed language) can be bound to the program library based on C + GObject. In the current version, user experience is optimized, new features are added, and a large number of bugs are fixed. Xfce occupies fewer memory and CPU resources than other UIs (GNOME and KDE), providing smoother and more efficient user experience.

Xfce supports the x86\_64 and AArch64 architectures.

 9. FAQs
**Why Is the Background Color of the LightDM Login Page Black?**
The login page is black because `background` is not set in the default configuration file **/etc/lightdm/lightdm-gtk-greeter.conf** of lghtdm-gtk.
Set `background=/usr/share/backgrounds/xfce/xfce-blue.jpg` in the `greeter` section at the end of the configuration file, and then run the `systemctl restart lightdm` command.
