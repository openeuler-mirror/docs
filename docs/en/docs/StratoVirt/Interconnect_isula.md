# Connecting to the iSula Security Container

## Overview

To provide a better isolation environment for containers and improve system security, you can use the iSula secure container, that is, connect StratoVirt to the iSula secure container.

## Connecting to the iSula Security Container

### **Prerequisites**

The iSulad and kata-containers have been installed, and the iSulad supports the kata-runtime container runtime and the devicemapper storage driver.

The following describes how to install and configure iSulad and kata-containers.

1. Configure the yum repository and install iSulad and kata-containers as user root:

   ```shell
   # yum install iSulad
   # yum install kata-containers
   ```

2. Create and configure the storage:

   You need to plan the drive, for example, /dev/sdx, which will be formatted.

    ```shell
    # pvcreate /dev/sdxx
    # vgcreate isulaVG0 /dev/sdxx
    # lvcreate --wipesignatures y -n thinpool isulaVG0 -l 95%VG
    # lvcreate --wipesignatures y -n thinpoolmeta isulaVG0 -l 1%VG
    # lvconvert -y --zero n -c 512K --thinpool isulaVG0/thinpool --poolmetadata isulaVG0/thinpoolmeta
    ```

   Add the following information to the /etc/lvm/profile/isulaVG0-thinpool.profile configuration file:

    ```
    activation {
        thin_pool_autoextend_threshold=80
        thin_pool_autoextend_percent=20
    }
    ```

   Modify storage-driver and storage-opts in the /etc/isulad/daemon.json configuration file as follows. Set the default storage driver type overlay to devicemapper.

    ```
    "storage-driver": "devicemapper",
    "storage-opts": [
     "dm.thinpooldev=/dev/mapper/isulaVG0-thinpool",
     "dm.fs=ext4",
     "dm.min_free_space=10%"
    ],

3. Run the following command to restart isulad:

    ```shell
    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl restart isulad
    ```

4. Check whether the iSula storage driver is successfully configured:

    ```shell
    # isula info
    ```

     If the following information is displayed, the configuration is successful.

    ```
    Storage Driver: devicemapper
    ```

5. Open the /etc/isulad/daemon.json file. If kata-runtime is not configured, set runtime to kata-runtime.

   ```json
   "runtimes": {
       "kata-runtime": {
           "path": "/usr/bin/kata-runtime",
           "runtimeArgs": [
               "--kata-config",
               "/usr/share/defaults/kata-containers/configuration.toml"
           ]
       }
   },
   ```

### **Connection Guide**

StratoVirt connects to the iSula secure container, that is, StratoVirt connects to kata-runtime in the iSula secure container. The procedure is as follows:

1. Create the script file stratovirt.sh in any directory (for example, /home) and add the execution permission to the file as the root user:

   ```shell
   # touch /home/stratovirt.sh
   # chmod +x /home/stratovirt.sh
   ```

   The content of stratovirt.sh is as follows, which is used to specify the StratoVirt path:

   ```
   #!/bin/bash
   export STRATOVIRT_LOG_LEVEL=info  # set log level which includes trace, debug, info, warn and error.
   /usr/bin/stratovirt $@
   ```

   ​

2. Modify the kata configuration file (The default path is /usr/share/defaults/kata-containers/configuration.toml). Set the hypervisor type of the secure container to stratovirt, the kernel to the absolute path of the StratoVirt kernel image, and initrd to the initrd image file of kata-containers. When you use yum to install kata-containers, the two image files are downloaded by default and stored in the /var/lib/kata/ directory. You can also use other images during configuration.

   The configuration reference is as follows:

   ```shell
   [hypervisor.stratovirt]
   path = "/home/stratovirt.sh"
   kernel = "/var/lib/kata/vmlinux.bin"
   initrd = "/var/lib/kata/kata-containers-initrd.img"
   block_device_driver = "virtio-mmio"
   use_vsock = true
   enable_netmon = true
   internetworking_model="tcfilter"
   sandbox_cgroup_with_emulator = false
   disable_new_netns = false
   disable_block_device_use = false
   disable_vhost_net = true
   ```

3. Use the root permission and **isula** command to run the BusyBox secure container to interconnect with the StratoVirt to the secure container.

   ```shell
   # isula run -tid --runtime=kata-runtime --net=none --name test busybox:latest sh
   ```

4. Run the **isula ps** command to check whether the secure container test is running properly. If yes, run the following command to access the test container.

   ```
   # isula exec –ti test sh
   ```

 Now, you can run container commands in the test container.
