## Software and Hardware Requirements

### Hardware Requirement

-   Huawei Kunpeng 920 processor

### Software Requirement

-   OS: openEuler 20.03 LTS SP3

## Environment Preparation

For details about installing an openEuler OS, see  _openEuler 20.03 LTS SP3 Installation Guide_.

## A-Tune Installation

This chapter describes the installation modes and methods of the A-Tune.

### Installation Modes

A-Tune can be installed in single-node or distributed mode.

-   Single-node mode

    The client and server are installed on the same system.

-   Distributed mode

    The client and server are installed on different systems.


The installation modes are as follows:

### Installation Procedure

To install the A-Tune, perform the following steps:

1.  Mount an openEuler ISO file.

    ```
    # mount openEuler-20.03-LTS-SP3-aarch64-dvd.iso /mnt
    ```

2.  Configure the local yum source.

    ```
    # vim /etc/yum.repos.d/local.repo
    ```

    The configured contents are as follows:

    ```
    [local]
    name=local
    baseurl=file:///mnt
    gpgcheck=1
    enabled=1
    ```

3.  Import the GPG public key of the RPM digital signature to the system.

    ```
    # rpm --import /mnt/RPM-GPG-KEY-openEuler
    ```


4. Install an A-Tune server.

    >![](./public_sys-resources/icon-note.gif) **NOTE:**   
    >In this step, both the server and client software packages are installed. For the single-node deployment, skip  **Step 5**.  

    ```
    # yum install atune -y
    # yum install atune-engine -y
    ```

5.  For a distributed mode, install an A-Tune client on associated server.

    ```
    # yum install atune-client -y
    ```

6.  Check whether the installation is successful.

    ```
    # rpm -qa | grep atune
    atune-client-xxx
    atune-db-xxx
    atune-xxx
    atune-engine-xxx
    ```
    
    If the preceding information is displayed, the installation is successful.


## A-Tune Deployment

This chapter describes how to deploy A-Tune.



### Overview

The configuration items in the A-Tune configuration file  **/etc/atuned/atuned.cnf**  are described as follows:

- A-Tune service startup configuration

    You can modify the parameter value as required.

    -   **protocol**: Protocol used by the gRPC service. The value can be  **unix**  or  **tcp**.  **unix**  indicates the local socket communication mode, and  **tcp**  indicates the socket listening port mode. The default value is  **unix**.
    -   **address**: Listening IP address of the gRPC service. The default value is  **unix socket**. If the gRPC service is deployed in distributed mode, change the value to the listening IP address.
    -   **port**: Listening port of the gRPC server. The value ranges from 0 to 65535. If **protocol** is set to **unix**, you do not need to set this parameter.
    -   **connect**: IP address list of the nodes where the A-Tune is located when the A-Tune is deployed in a cluster. IP addresses are separated by commas (,).
    -   **rest_host**: Listening address of the REST service. The default value is localhost.
    -   **rest_port**: Listening port of the REST service. The value ranges from 0 to 65535. The default value is 8383.
    -   **engine_host**: IP address for connecting to the A-Tune engine service of the system.
    -   **engine_port**: Port for connecting to the A-Tune engine service of the system.
    -   **sample_num**: Number of samples collected when the system executes the analysis process. The default value is 20.
    -   **interval**: Interval for collecting samples when the system executes the analysis process. The default value is 5s.
    -   **grpc_tls**: Indicates whether to enable SSL/TLS certificate verification for the gRPC service. By default, this function is disabled. After grpc_tls is enabled, you need to set the following environment variables before running the **atune-adm** command to communicate with the server:
        -   export ATUNE_TLS=yes
        -   export ATUNED_CACERT=\<Path of the client CA certificate\>
        -   export ATUNED_CLIENTCERT=\<Client certificate path\>
        -   export ATUNED_CLIENTKEY=\<Client key path\>
        -   export ATUNED_SERVERCN=server
    -   **tlsservercafile**: Path of the gPRC server's CA certificate.
    -   **tlsservercertfile**: Path of the gPRC server certificate.
    -   **tlsserverkeyfile**: Path of the gPRC server key.
    -   **rest_tls**: Indicates whether to enable SSL/TLS certificate verification for the REST service. This function is enabled by default.
    -   **tlsrestcacertfile**: Path of the server's CA certificate of the REST service.
    -   **tlsrestservercertfile**: Path of the server certificate of the REST service.
    -   **tlsrestserverkeyfile**: Indicates the key path of the REST service.
    -   **engine_tls**: Indicates whether to enable SSL/TLS certificate verification for the A-Tune engine service. This function is enabled by default..
    -   **tlsenginecacertfile**: Path of the client CA certificate of the A-Tune engine service.
    -   **tlsengineclientcertfile**: Client certificate path of the A-Tune engine service.
    -   **tlsengineclientkeyfile**: Client key path of the A-Tune engine service.

-   System information

    System is the parameter information required for system optimization. You must modify the parameter information according to the actual situation.

    -   **disk**: Disk information to be collected during the analysis process or specified disk during disk optimization.
    -   **network**: NIC information to be collected during the analysis process or specified NIC during NIC optimization.
    -   **user**: User name used for ulimit optimization. Currently, only the user  **root**  is supported.
    
-   Log information

    Change the log level as required. The default log level is info. Log information is recorded in the **/var/log/messages** file.

-   Monitor information

    Hardware information that is collected by default when the system is started.
    
-   Tuning information

    Tuning is the parameter information required for offline tuning.
    
    -   **noise**: Evaluation value of Gaussian noise.
    -   **sel_feature**: Indicates whether to enable the function of generating the importance ranking of offline tuning parameters. By default, this function is disabled.
